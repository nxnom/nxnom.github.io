## Introduction

{{ page.description }}

This is the first app I worked on as a team. I was hired as a contract based flutter developer. 
I worked on this app for 3 months. I was responsible for leading the development of the app.

This project have two type of app, Merchant app and User app. 
Before I joined the team, the team was building app without sharing any codebase. 
So I proposed an idea to share codebase and build two apps from one codebase.
First, I create core package which contains all the business logic and shared UI components.
Then I notice that the team was using custom icons for each app, so I create icon package to share icons.

> I don't know the project is canceled or continue. The development is stopped 
> because of the pandemic.
