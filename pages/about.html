<h2>About Me</h2>

  </summary>

  <p>
    I was first introduced to programming at 2011 when I started my first year
    at university. I was actively coding for 3 years and then I stopped for 5
    years and only using tools like workpress. I started coding again in 2019
    and I've been coding ever since. At that time, I just wanted to convert my
    wordpress website to android app and I can't find opensource project suited
    to my project. So I don't have any choice but to code again. Flutter is
    kinda hot at that moment, so I started learning flutter and I've been using
    flutter ever since.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem">
    I post about my project on facebook and ppl started asking me to make app
    for them. So, I started working for them and become a freelancer. But you
    know I cannot do everying with flutter. So I started learning javascript and
    React.js for web development and Node.js for backend development.
